**Explain the significance of public, protected and private access specifiers in
inheritance.**

Access specifiers (`public`, `protected`, `private`, and default) play a crucial role in determining the visibility and accessibility of fields and methods within classes, especially when it comes to inheritance in Java. These access specifiers help define the scope of visibility of members (fields and methods) from one class in its subclasses.

Here's how these access specifiers impact inheritance:

1. **`public` Access Specifier:**
   - Members declared as `public` are accessible from any class, whether it's in the same package or a different package.
   - In inheritance, if a superclass member is declared as `public`, it is inherited by the subclass and retains its `public` visibility. The subclass can access the inherited member using the same access level.

2. **`protected` Access Specifier:**
   - Members declared as `protected` are accessible within the same package and in subclasses, regardless of whether they're in the same or different packages.
   - Inheritance involving `protected` members allows the subclass to inherit the member, and it can be accessed in the subclass with the `protected` access level.

3. **Default (Package-Private) Access Specifier:**
   - Members declared without any access specifier (also known as package-private or default) are accessible only within the same package.
   - Inheritance with default access members allows the subclass to inherit the member if the subclass is in the same package as the superclass.

4. **`private` Access Specifier:**
   - Members declared as `private` are only accessible within the same class. They are not inherited by subclasses.
   - Subclasses cannot directly access `private` members of the superclass, which means they cannot inherit or override them.


- **`public` Members:** Are inherited with their `public` visibility intact and can be accessed in subclasses using the same access level.
- **`protected` Members:** Are inherited and can be accessed in subclasses using the `protected` access level.
- **Default (Package-Private) Members:** Are inherited and can be accessed in subclasses only if the subclass is in the same package.
- **`private` Members:** Are not inherited by subclasses and cannot be accessed directly by them.

It's important to note that the access level in a subclass cannot be more restrictive than the access level in the superclass. For example, you cannot override a `protected` method with a `private` method in a subclass.

Inheritance, along with access specifiers, allows you to define the visibility of class members and control the access to those members in subclasses. This helps in designing well-encapsulated and maintainable class hierarchies.

**Differentiate abstract classes and interfaces**

Abstract classes and interfaces are both used in object-oriented programming to define contracts that classes must adhere to, but they serve slightly different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here's a differentiation between the two:

**Abstract Classes:**
1. **Definition:** An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and may contain a mix of both abstract (unimplemented) and concrete (implemented) methods.
2. **Method Implementation:** Abstract classes can have methods with or without implementations. This means they can provide a default behavior for some methods while leaving others to be implemented by their subclasses.
3. **Inheritance:** Subclasses of an abstract class are required to implement all the abstract methods defined in the parent abstract class.
4. **Access Modifiers:** Abstract classes can have access modifiers (public, protected, private) for their methods and fields.
5. **Constructor:** Abstract classes can have constructors, which are called when an instance of a subclass is created. These constructors can initialize shared properties or perform common actions.
6. **Usage:** Abstract classes are suitable when you want to provide a common base class with some shared implementation while still enforcing the implementation of certain methods in derived classes.

**Interfaces:**
1. **Definition:** An interface is a contract that specifies a set of methods that a class must implement. It doesn't contain any method implementations, only method declarations (method signatures).
2. **Method Implementation:** All methods in an interface are implicitly abstract and must be implemented by any class that implements the interface. There's no default implementation provided in interfaces.
3. **Inheritance:** A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to provide implementations for all the methods defined in those interfaces.
4. **Access Modifiers:** All methods in an interface are implicitly public, and fields are implicitly public, static, and final (constants).
5. **Constructor:** Interfaces cannot have constructors, as they don't define any implementation or state.
6. **Usage:** Interfaces are used when you want to define a contract that multiple unrelated classes can adhere to. They enable achieving multiple inheritances of behavior in languages that don't support multiple inheritance of classes.

**Define array? Write a program to perform multiplication of two matrices?**

An array in Java is a data structure that can hold a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type. Arrays provide a way to store multiple values in a single variable, allowing for efficient data manipulation and retrieval.

Here's an example program to perform matrix multiplication using arrays:

```java
public class MatrixMultiplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] matrix1 = {
            {1, 2, 3},
            {4, 5, 6},
            {7, 8, 9}
        };

        int[][] matrix2 = {
            {9, 8, 7},
            {6, 5, 4},
            {3, 2, 1}
        };

        int rows1 = matrix1.length;
        int cols1 = matrix1[0].length;
        int cols2 = matrix2[0].length;

        int[][] resultMatrix = new int[rows1][cols2];

        for (int i = 0; i < rows1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols2; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k < cols1; k++) {
                    resultMatrix[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j];
                }
            }
        }

        // Print the result matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < rows1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols2; j++) {
                System.out.print(resultMatrix[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

In this program, we define two matrices `matrix1` and `matrix2` using 2D arrays. We then calculate the number of rows and columns for each matrix. The matrix multiplication algorithm involves iterating through the rows of the first matrix, columns of the second matrix, and the common dimension (columns of the first matrix or rows of the second matrix), and accumulating the products to populate the result matrix `resultMatrix`.

Finally, we print the contents of the `resultMatrix`, which is the product of the two input matrices.
